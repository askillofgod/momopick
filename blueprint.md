# Project Blueprint

## Overview

This project is a simple, modern, and visually appealing single-page web application. It serves as a starting point for building a framework-less web project using modern web standards.

## Style, Design, and Features

### Initial Version (v1)

*   **Layout:** A centered, single-column layout that is responsive.
*   **Typography:** Clean and readable fonts sourced from Google Fonts.
*   **Color Palette:** A modern and vibrant color scheme.
*   **Styling:**
    *   Subtle noise texture for the background.
    *   Soft drop shadows on elements to create depth.
    *   Interactive "glow" effect on buttons.
*   **Content:**
    *   A main heading and a subheading.
    *   A primary call-to-action button.
    *   A placeholder for a feature image.
    *   A simple footer.

## Current Plan

### Make the index page beautiful

*   **Goal:** Transform the current basic `index.html` into a visually appealing page.
*   **Steps:**
    1.  **Update `index.html`:** Add a more structured and semantic HTML structure, including a header, main content area, and a footer. Add a placeholder for an image.
    2.  **Update `style.css`:** Apply a modern design with a new color palette, typography, and layout. This will include responsive design, CSS variables, and effects.
    3.  **Update `main.js`:** No major changes planned for JavaScript in this step, but will ensure it's linked correctly.
